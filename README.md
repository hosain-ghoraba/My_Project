1 - This is a simple travelling website , based on client/server architecture

2 - The website allows users to
     - create an account
     - lookup several travelling destinations
     - add places to their “want-to-go list” 
     - search for travelling destinations
     
3 - It only works nearly properly if it is connected to a LOCAL "Mongodb" database (on the computer running the application) , with the same database and collection
    names hardcoded in the application ,
    but not designed to work properly on the deployed version of it , with link : https://team48-networks.onrender.com/
