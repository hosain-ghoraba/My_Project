1 - This is a simple travelling website , based on client/server architecture <br />

2 - The website allows users to : <br />
     - create an account <br />
     - lookup several travelling destinations <br />
     - add places to their “want-to-go list”  <br />
     - search for travelling destinations <br />
     
3 - It only works nearly properly if it is connected to a LOCAL "Mongodb" database (on the computer running the application) , with the same database and collection <br />
    names hardcoded in the application , <br />
    but not designed to work properly on the deployed version of it , with link : https://team48-networks.onrender.com/
