1 - This is a simple travelling website , based on client/server architecture <br />

2 - The website allows users to : <br />
     - create an account <br />
     - lookup several travelling destinations <br />
     - add places to their “want-to-go list”  <br />
     - search for travelling destinations <br />
     
3 - It only works nearly properly if it is connected to a LOCAL "Mongodb" database (on the computer running the application) , with the same database and collection 
    names hardcoded in the application , <br />
    deployed version link : https://team48-networks.onrender.com/ <br />
    use username 'admin' and password 'admin' to login in the deployed version to test (part) of its functionalities , full functionalities can only be tested locally
